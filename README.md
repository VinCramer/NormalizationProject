# NormalizationProject
A project in which a dataset is fully normalized using SQL. This is based on a SQL course project from Farmingdale.

The chosen dataset that was normalized was https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/news-aggregator-dataset/data. 

Note: the control file fixes most of the records, but some of the records were separated by tabs instead of spaces. This was fixed using find and replace in a text editor.
