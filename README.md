# NormalizationProject
A project in which a dataset is fully normalized using SQL. This is based on a SQL course project from Farmingdale.

The chosen dataset that was normalized was https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/news-aggregator-dataset/data. 

Note: the control file fixes most of the records, but some of the records were separated by tabs instead of spaces. This was fixed using find and replace in a text editor. Additionally, some of the URLs contain commas, so if this project is to be replicated the erroneous records must have their URLs enclosed by double quotes (roughly 100 records).
